# XCode



XCode is our film review website. We have completed this in Visual Studio. There is a solution file which is on GitHub. This includes all the code to make the film review website work as designed. 


We have included all documentation for the Film Review website under the 'Documentation' folder. These have also been documented as issues, however, we have consolidated them into one folder for easy viewing.
